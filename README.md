# Redcare pharmacy home task

This is a React-based application for Redcare pharmacy.

Project build with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as builder and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) as a state manager.

For UI building, I chose [antd](https://ant.design/) library. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install foobar.

```bash
npm i
```

Required node version is **20+**

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal. Local address will be in terminal.
Keep in mind, that linter is running at the same time with dev build.
